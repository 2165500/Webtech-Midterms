Midterm Project No. 1
Saint Louis University Library
CMS : WordPress

INITIAL PLAN FOR THE CONTENT
First, we will be creating a theme for our SLU Library website from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP

Then we'll be creating some generic pages structures within the PAGES section of the WordPress such as:

About SLU Library: This page contains a brief description of the SLU library and their organizational chart.

Books: In this page, it shows all the available books and book categories in the library.

Magazines: In this page, we can view different magazine categories and all the magazines available.

Research Papers: In this page, it shows available research papers.

News and Announcements: In this page, the admin can post announcements and news which can be viewed by the users and keep them updated and informed.

Contact us: This section displays the contact details of the library.

FAQ: This resource was created to answer questions that are commonly asked by the library users and get help from a librarian at anytime.
